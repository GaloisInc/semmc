semmc-coverage
==============

This package provides a command-line tool, semmc-coverage, that
prints out lists of instructions for a given architecture that have
no semantics in the corresponding SemMC architecture package. This is
primarily a development aid to tell where we have more semantics work to
do but should also be useful whenever the ISA changes in dismantle so we
can tell whether we have coverage of the new instructions in the SemMC
semantics for that architecture.
