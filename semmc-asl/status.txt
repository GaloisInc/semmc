* bits(N) - passing in N as a parameter and returning it

In the signature of a function we also have an optional argument that indicates
whether that function requires a Nat to be passed in at the call site. Then, when
translating a function call, we look up the signature by name and argument types, but
we need to somehow allow the lookup function to "match" with a polymorphic argument
type. 

* Functions with same name and same number of arguments, but differently typed
  arguments (Abs)

During signature translation, we will store the argument types as part of the key in
the lookup table.

At call sites, we'll have to look up which function to use based on not just its
name, but also the types of its arguments. Hopefully that is enough -- although it
could also be the case that a function can be overloaded not just with respect to the
types of its arguments, but also with respect to the return value, which would be
even grosser.

* Figure out how to handle IMPLEMENTATION_DEFINED
