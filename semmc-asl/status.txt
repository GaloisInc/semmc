Things of note

* Global variables
Current approach is to declare these in code rather than translate them from ASL --
there are few enough of them, I think, to do this without too much pain. However, I
don't think it would be too much effort to do this the "right" way -- I just haven't
gotten around to it and haven't had any need.

ASL syntax translation TODOs

* bits(N) - passing in N as a parameter and returning it

In the signature of a function we also have an optional argument that indicates
whether that function requires a Nat to be passed in at the call site. Then, when
translating a function call, we look up the signature by name and argument types, but
we need to somehow allow the lookup function to "match" with a polymorphic argument
type. 

For now, I'm just going to handle these on a case-by-case basis to just get an
instruction translated all the way, but we will have to come up with a more general
mechanism at some point.

* Functions with same name and same number of arguments, but differently typed
  arguments (Abs)

During signature translation, we will store the argument types as part of the key in
the lookup table.

At call sites, we'll have to look up which function to use based on not just its
name, but also the types of its arguments. Hopefully that is enough -- although it
could also be the case that a function can be overloaded not just with respect to the
types of its arguments, but also with respect to the return value, which would be
even grosser.

I'm not sure if the Abs function is used in any of the instructions we care about.

* Figure out how to handle IMPLEMENTATION_DEFINED

* Figure out how to force preprocessing to provide signatures for all functions on
  the dependency graph so that translation doesn't choke.

* Fix procedure translation

* Fix RBankSelect

toSSA raises an exception because the "result" register is never allocated in the
"unreachable" case. I'm not sure what to do here - is there any construct in crucible
that models "panic"? At the moment, I'm just detecting "Unreachable" in case blocks
and pre-empting them by interpreting the previous case as an "otherwise".
