This directory contains pairs of files with extensions ".info" and ".bytes". The two
are in correspondence; the .info file is a text file where each line of
pseudo-assembly corresponds to a single instuction in the .bytes file. The .bytes
file contains ARM/Thumb instructions. I've done this for convenience so it's easy to
view these instructions in psittacine in order to examine how they are disassembled
by dismantle.
